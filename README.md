# Lab 2 - Undoing changes
As a developer you're occasionally faced with the need to undo (or rather redo) a series of commits – just like the original poster of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git) Stack Overflow question (with over 10M views).

Common reasons are:
- Accidentally committed files, such as logs, binaries, or libraries
- Embarassing typo in commit message
- Committing changes on the wrong branch, e.g. straight in `main` instead of in a feature branch.

In this assignment we'll learn how to rework our history based on some common problems.

## Purpose & Goal
- Get comfortable undoing changes and rework your git history
- Deepen our knowledge about `remote` vs `local`
- Learn about do's and dont's related to rewriting public histories
- Understand the difference between `log` and `reflog`

## Expectations
- Work in pairs
- For actions/operations performed on one computer – pair program!
